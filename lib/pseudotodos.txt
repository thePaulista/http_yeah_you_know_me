------Iteration 0 - Hello, World (0)
Todo: Build a HTTP server
Case:  That fetches a web page
And:     Given an HTTP server on port 9292
    And a file "some.html" with
    """
    <html>
    <body>
    Hello, World (0) with incrementing counter
    </body>
    </html>
    """
    When I fetch "http://localhost:5000/"
    Then I should see "Hello, World (0)
    with an incrementing counter until server is restarted
    Hopefully! :-)

Pseudocode

initialize HTTP server with an HTTP request
  accept request
  add a counter

in the main runner do:
loop through each request that comes in, and output
with a webpage in some.html file that says
"HOLA PLANETA AZUL! (0)"
